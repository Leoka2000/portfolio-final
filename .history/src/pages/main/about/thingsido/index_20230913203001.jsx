            <h1>My story</h1>
            <p>My first real world experience I had with programming was when my friend founded a startup and was complaining to me how expensive it is to hire a programmer to develop a website. At that point I had been doing some self-studying in JS, which was enough for me to start learning React to maker her a website. After this experience I grew passionate about coding and started developing myself in this field.</p>
            <p>In my free time I am a language learner. Aside from my native language, I also speak English, Hungarian, and a bit of Italian.</p>
